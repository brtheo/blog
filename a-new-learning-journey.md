As a developer the learning process of a new language is often tedious.
You don't know where to begin, you quickly feel overwhelmed and you start entering the tutorial hell ...

All of this for nothing and **zero results**.
Pretty sad.

## Beginning of a new journey
Lately I found myself in a similar situation where I wanted something new, something different than the languages I was use to.
And with the surrounding hypes around two *new* languages, namely Rust and Go, I quickly started experimenting stuff.

### Starting with Rust

Ok, yeah I'm good for now.

### Quickly switch to learning Go instead

Aside from its undeniably charismatic mascot, Go felt like a piece of cake for programmers.
- Straight forward syntax
- Compiling speed
- Great ecosystem

And by trial-and-error and tediously reading the doc I've managed to get few little side projects done.

## Time goes by...
And I discovered the grail of learning : [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) (and [Golings](https://github.com/mauricioabreu/golings)).

>I must admit my interest for Go ran off a bit with two things :
>* Capitalizing public members of a module
>* Horrible Generics syntax
>* Too restrictive syntax in general
>
>And reaimed myself towards Rust when I heard about [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos).

### What's Rustlings ?
It's a CLI prompting you to complete rust related exercices with a genuinely good learning curve.

Then open the current exercice `.rs` file in your code editor and let's go.

You can type `hint` to get a handful of tips on the current exercice.

You aren't restricted when it comes to the solution, you're free to experiment with the language syntax to find a clever way to solve the exercice.

Happy learning !
