There's several ways of creating a blog nowadays, whether it is with a legacy CMS such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) whether it is by taking a more modern approach using a headless CMS solution like [Strapi](https://strapi.io) or even building it with [Astro](https://astro.build) through their brand new feature [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).

Bref, there're plenty of solutions.

## Why not build it ourselves ?
